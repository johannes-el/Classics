#+TITLE: Classic games written in C/C++ using the raylib library (WIP)
#+AUTHOR: Johannes Elsing

This repository contains multiple classic games developed using the raylib library. The games are written in either C or C++.
Each game has its own directory with source code, assets, and build scripts.

** Prerequisites
- Ensure you have a C/C++ compiler (gcc), and make installed on your system.

** Game List

|----------------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| *Game*         | *Description*                                       |

| [[file:Arkanoid/][Arkanoid]]       | A classic brick-breaking game.                      |
|----------------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| [[file:Asteroids/][Asteroids]]      | A space-themed game where you destroy asteroids.    |
|----------------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| [[file:SpaceInvaders/][Space Invaders]] | A version of the classic shooter game.              |

** Game Folders Structure

Each game folder has the following structure:

- =src/=: Contains the game's source code (C/C++).
- =Assets/=: Contains sprites, textures, and audio assets used in the game.
- =Makefile= or =CMakeLists.txt=: Build instructions for compiling the game.

** Dependencies

The Raylib library is included in the =deps/= folder:
- =deps/include/raylib.h=
- =deps/lib/linux/libraylib.a=

To build any game, navigate to its folder and run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  make
#+END_SRC

For games using CMake, use:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ..
  make
#+END_SRC
